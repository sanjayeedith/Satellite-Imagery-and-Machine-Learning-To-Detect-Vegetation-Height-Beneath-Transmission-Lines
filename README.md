# Satellite-Imagery-and-Machine-Learning-To-Detect-Vegetation-Height-Beneath-Transmission-Lines

The project aims to develop an innovative system leveraging satellite imagery and machine learning to address the challenge of vegetation interference beneath transmission lines. Current methods for monitoring and managing vegetation growth along power transmission corridors are often reactive and resource-intensive, leading to potential risks of outages and infrastructure damage.
